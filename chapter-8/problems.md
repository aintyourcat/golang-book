1. We can get the memory address of a variable using the & operator, e.g: &x to get the memory address of variable x.
2. To assign a value to a pointer, we have to dereference the pointer variable while assigning a value to it, e.g: \*x = 0 to assign 0 to the pointer x.
3. We can create a new variable using the new function and & operator.
