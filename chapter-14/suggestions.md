# How best to master the craft of programming

Although we have learned all the information we need to write most Go programs, it would be dangerous to conclude that we're competent programmers.

1. Study the masters

    Study the source code produced by others. Go's source code is freely available at [here](http://golang.org/src/pkg). For example [here](http://golang.org/src/pkg/io/ioutil/ioutil.go) is the source code to the `io/util` library. Read the code slowly and deliberately. Try to understand every line and read the supplied comments.

2. Make something

    Practice coding is one of the best way to hone our skills. We could work on challenging programming problems from sites like [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) or try your hand at a larger project. Perhaps try to implement a web server or write a simple game.

3. Team up

    Most real-world software projects are done in teams, therefore learning how to work in a team is crucial. If you can, find someone, team up on a project, learn how to divide it into pieces you can both work on simultaneously.

    Another option is to contribute on open source project. Find a third party library, write some code (perhaps fix a bug), and submit it to maintainer. Go has a growing community which can be reached via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts).
